This module allows one to overlay images, similar to how Facebook allowed its
users to drape a rainbow flag over their profile pictures after the United
States of America's Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. An example
of its use can be found in the "test" directory. This module's test command
assumes that the user has mocha installed globally. If this is not the case,
then please either install it globally before attempting to run the tests.
